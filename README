This is a collection of level sets for the Tile World Planner.
The data directory contains levelsets, and the sets directory contains *.dac
files containing Tile World levelset metadata (which ruleset to use).

Additionally, c4 is the perl script to convert between level formats.

For example, classical.txt was generated with the command:
$ c4 data/classical.dat classical.txt

TXT level format and c4 documentation can be viewed with the command:
$ perldoc c4
